Lesson 4 - A responsive HTML5 professional landing page with interaction and animation.
=================

I've included a zip file here with some starter images for this tutorial.    

Most of the code for this tutorial comes from samples and tutorials from other sources such as Twitter Bootstrap and Paper.js.  

We start with the Bootstrap Carousel Page template and modify it for our needs.

We add a custom modal feature using Bootstrap's built-in component.

We'll explore a bit of Javascript programming with each of these components.  

Next, we'll add a Wavy Footer using the HTML5 CANVAS element and by modifying (simplifying) a sample Javascript program.

There are many other components and canvas libraries for you to explore from here, take some time to create an amazing business landing page that can help get you or your client new business in a snap.
